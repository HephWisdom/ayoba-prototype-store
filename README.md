# ayoba-prototype-store
This is a micro app prototype for ayoba to demonstrate the relevance of E-Shop in Ghana to bridge the gap of wholesales and retailers.

In Ghana, there is little real-time transaction and communication between suppliers and retailers of wholesales goods(foods,drinks, clothes etc). Creating a platform which allows all retailers and wholesales to have equal opportunities to the time the goods are and will be available will increase the productivity between competitors on the platform, make users (wholesales and retails) know their customers who are yet to be discovered, and helps users find more alternatives if they find some prices of goods unreal.  There are a lot of opportunities to explore once this project is able to come to life. the main goal is to help businesses that engages in wholesales and retails to connect to one-another.
